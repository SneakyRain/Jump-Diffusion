To conclude, we have discussed and compare the Black-Scholes model and the Merton Jump-Diffusion model in the indian context.
We try to find whether the MJD model is significantly more suitable for empirical stock prices. 
We apply the two models to simulate the prices of different stocks traded in the Indian stock market, and present our findings here. 
The parameters for the two models that best fit the empirical data were found using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
From our experiments, we found that newly listed stocks have higher volatility compared to large-cap companies, with much more frequent price jumps.
Since the MJD model is able to model fluctuations caused by jumps/falls, it performs much better than a simble SBM.
Based on visual evidence, we found that the MJD model is better able to predict the future movement of stock prices.
