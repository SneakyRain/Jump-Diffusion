        In this paper, we compare two stock price models : Black Scholes model and Merton Jump Diffusion model. 
        We first derive the underlying ideas behind both the models, then present a method to simulate them.
        We finally compare the performance of these models on multiple stocks traded in the Indian Stock Market.
        Our experiments found that the Merton Jump Diffusion Model (MJD) provides a much better approximation to the empirical distribution of the returns, compared to the Black Scholes Model (BSM).
        They also indicate that the difference in performance is even more evident in newer stocks with higher volatility, which are thus better modeled using MJD.
